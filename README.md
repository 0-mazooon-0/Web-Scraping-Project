# Web-Scraping-Project
## Important !! : The images downloaded may need manual cleaning to your fit
This is a project that scrapes (download) a big amount of images through a normal google search.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
- This tool might get better result from the second time. So, I kindly ask you to run it more than once (2-3 times) until you get the best result.
- Take care of your topic spelling because it may reduce the amount of downloaded photos.
- When running on the same topic again make sure to delete the folder that contain the previous images to let the script create the folder ans save images in it.
- It's mandatory to download a chrome webdriver for this code to work (chromedriver only works for this code).<br>

Setup:
- Download the files of your webdriver.<br><br>
  It should look something like this :
  
<img width="1542" height="818" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0273a2e-4128-4efe-819a-e28a2467ed2a" />

- Put the script in the same file then run script.<br>
  note: You can choose where to download images but the default is in the same directory as the file that contains the py script
